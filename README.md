For the first Moltran installation, download MoltranSetupWin7.exe (win7-10) and run it. 
Due to Windows restrictions, it is recommended to use simple program folder (e.g. c:\moltran) instead of Program Files.

After installing Moltran, to update the program, you only need to download the latest exe version (moltran_r????.exe) 
Download it to the program folder and rename it to moltran.exe
