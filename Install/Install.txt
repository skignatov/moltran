                              MOLTRAN v.2.5

                       MANUAL INSTALLATION NOTES

1. RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
   - Intel or Intel-compatible processor with clock speed 800 MHz or higher
   - 128 Mb RAM or higher
   - Display resolution 1024x768
   - Operating system: Windows2000, WindowsXP

2. MANUAL INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:
   1. Copy distributive files to any directory (e.g. c:\Moltran\)
   2. Add this directory to your system PATH variable
      (Pusk->Nastroika->Panel upravleniya->Sistema->Dopolnitelno->
      ->Peremennye sredy->Sistemnye peremennye->"Path"->Izmenit...)
      Add your directory name to the end of PATH sequence ("Znachenie 
      peremennoi") and press OK, OK. 
   3. Add new environment variable MOLTRAN=<your_MOLTRAN_directory>
      (Pusk->Nastroika->Panel upravleniya->Sistema->Dopolnitelno->
      ->Peremennye sredy->Sistemnye peremennye->Sozdat...)
      Set "Imya peremennoi"     : MOLTRAN 
          "Znachenie peremennoi": c:\Moltran\
      Press OK, OK.
   4. Restart computer.

      Notes: 1. For WindowsXP or Win95-98, the button names are somewhat
                different but the general command sequence is the same.
             2. If your directory is exactly c:\Moltran, it is not
                necessary to do step 3 (this is default directory).


5. RUNNING MOLTRAN:

   METHOD 1. (for Windows lovers).
   1. Create a shortcut on your desctop directed to your MOLTRAN directory
      and MOLTRAN.EXE file. The shortcut icon is also inside Moltran.exe file.
   2. Click the shortcut twice. The opening dialog will appear asking for
      file name and job options. Set them properly and press OK button.

   METHOD 2. (for tough guys and girls)
   1. Run any console file processor (FAR, WinCommander,NortonCommander etc).
   2. Goto directory where your OUT-file is located (file with quantum 
      chemical results).
   3. Type the command string:      MOLTRAN <your out-filename> <options>
      and press ENTER.    Example:

              moltran h2o.out /thermo600-1000-25 /rot2 /scale0.95
   
      For description of job options see Moltran manual (Moltran.txt)


4. KNOWN PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
   If your system is not compliant with the system requirements mentioned 
   above, some known bugs can probably appear:

   - On computers with slower processors, the delays appear when
     screen navigation keys are pressed (i.e. during rotation and
     moving of molecules)

   - On computers with older OS (Win95,Win98,WinNT), the FileOpen dialogs
     will probably not appear when you press "Browse...." buttons.
     (try to upgrade comctl32.dll library to newer version. It is
     located in your system directory - c:\Windows\System of Win95).

   - On computers with display resolution 800x600 and lower, 
     some dialogs will have not enough space on the screen to be 
     shown completely.

   - On computers with memory size lower 128 Mb, the program can probably
     fail to run. (Use the short version of Moltran compiled
     for only 100 atoms. It needs much less memory)

    
5. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND CAN CONTAIN
   BUGS AND ERRORS. WE SHOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING YOUR COMMENTS,
   ADVICES, BUG REPORTS AND REQUESTS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
